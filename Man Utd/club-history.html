            <p class="founding">Founded in 1878 as newton heath l&yr football club, our club has operated for over 140 years. The team first entered the english first division, then the highest league in english football, for the start of the 1892-93 season. Our club name changed to manchester united football club in 1902, and we won the first of our 20 english league titles in 1908. In 1910, we moved to old trafford, our current stadium. </p>
            <p class="fergie">In 1986, our club appointed Sir Alex Ferguson as manager. In 1990, we won the FA Cup and began a period of success that has continued until the present day. Since 1992, we have won the Premier League 13 times. In total, we have won a record 20 English League titles, a record 12 FA Cups, 4 League Cups, 3 European Champions Cups and 1 FIFA Club World Cup, making us one of the most successful clubs in England.</p>
            <p class="legends">Since the inception of the Premier League in 1992, our club has enjoyed consistent success and growth with popular players such as Eric Cantona, David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. The popularity of these players, our distinguished tradition and history, and the on-field success of our first team have allowed us to expand the club into a global brand with an international follower base.</p>
